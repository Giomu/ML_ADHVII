This repository contains the code associated with the paper titled "***Machine Learning Approaches to Dissect Hybrid and Vaccine-Induced Immunity***" authored by *G. Montesi, S. Costagli et al*.

## Overview

The project focuses on developing a Machine Learning pipeline designed to dissect and predict immune response profiles associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. The pipeline integrates both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches to characterize hybrid and vaccine-induced immunity.

In the unsupervised component (code in `1_Clustering.R`), the pipeline leverages dimensionality reduction techniques (UMAP and t-SNE) in combination with a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify distinct immune response patterns based on 12 immunological variables (`data1.rda`). This enables the discovery of latent subgroups within the data without prior knowledge of infection or vaccination status.

In the supervised component (code in `2_Classification.R`), a suite of classification algorithms (k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines with Radial Basis Function kernel and Random Forest) is implemented to distinguish between profiles of hybrid immunity (i.e., vaccine plus prior infection) and vaccine-induced-only immunity using a labelled dataset (`data2.rda`). The trained models are subsequently applied by using a consensus approach to an unlabelled dataset (`data3.rda`) to infer individuals with potential prior unrecognized infection—referred to as *unaware infected*—based solely on their immunological signatures.

This repository provides the full implementation of the analysis presented in the manuscript, including all code, datasets, and detailed instructions for reproducing the results.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analyses presented in the manuscript and run the pipeline locally, please follow the steps below:

1.  **Install R**

    Download and install the latest version of R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): [https://cran.r-project.org](#0) .

2.  **Install RStudio (Recommended IDE)**

    Download and install RStudio, a powerful and user-friendly IDE for R: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> .

3.  **Clone the Repository**

    You can clone this repository using Git from the command line:

    ```{bash}
    git clone https://github.com/Giomu/ML_ADHVII.git
    ```

    Alternatively, you can download the ZIP archive directly from GitHub and extract it.

4.  **Open the Project in RStudio**

    Open the `ML_ADHVII.Rproj` file in RStudio. This will automatically load the project environment and working directory.

5.  **Install Required Packages**

    The pipeline relies on several R packages for dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification. You can install them by running in your R Console:

    ```{r}
    install.packages(c("mclust", 
                       "umap", 
                       "Rtsne", 
                       "ggplot2", 
                       "fpc", 
                       "caret", 
                       "dplyr", 
                       "MLmetrics",
                       "foreach",
                       "doParallel",
                       "stringr",
                       "purrr"))
    ```

    For proper installation and usage of these packages, please refer to the official documentation of each library, as system-specific dependencies or configuration steps may apply.

6.  **Run the Analysis**

    -   To reproduce the unsupervised immune profiling via UMAP/t-SNE + GMM, run `R/1_Clustering.R`

    -   To reproduce the supervised classification and unaware infection detection, run `R/2_Classification.R`

    -   Alternatively, you can explore the full pipeline interactively via the notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.

Detailed instructions on how to use the code, including examples, are provided within the notebook in the `notebooks/` directory. The notebook walk through the entire process from data loading to model evaluation.
